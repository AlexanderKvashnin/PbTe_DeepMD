# PbTe_DeepMD
Trained [DeepMD](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) potentials for simulations of mechanical properties of doped PbTe materials

TePbBiNa_pot.pb - is the potential designed for simulations of mechanical properties of Na-doped PbTe with presence of substitutional defects of Bi and Na

TePbCuAg_pot.pb - is the potential designed for simulations of mechanical properties of Na-doped PbTe with presence of interstitial defects of Cu and Ag


Later the training set for this potentials will be added
