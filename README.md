# PbTe_DeepMD
Trained [DeepMD](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) potentials for simulations of mechanical properties of doped PbTe materials

[TePbBiNa_pot.pb](https://github.com/AlexanderKvashnin/PbTe_DeepMD/blob/main/TePbBiNa_pot.pb) - is the potential designed for simulations of mechanical properties of PbTe with presence of substitutional defects of Bi and Na together with intrinsic defects like Pb/Te vacancies, Pb-to-Te substitutions 

[TePbCuAg_pot.pb](https://github.com/AlexanderKvashnin/PbTe_DeepMD/blob/main/TePbCuAg_pot.pb) - is the potential designed for simulations of mechanical properties of PbTe with presence of interstitial defects of Cu and Ag together with intrinsic defects like Pb/Te vacancies, Pb-to-Te substitutions 


Later the training set for this potentials will be added
